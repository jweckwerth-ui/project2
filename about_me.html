Nia Davis is a junior pursuing a dual major in Communications and Information Science. With a dynamic blend of creative and analytical interests, she is passionate about dance, design, and writing—fields that allow her to express ideas and explore human connection through various mediums. Her decision to enroll in this course stemmed from a genuine curiosity about the intersection of technology and society, particularly how demographic factors influence access, representation, and empowerment in digital spaces. As part of her Information Science curriculum, the class also fulfills a core academic requirement, aligning with her broader goal of understanding how code and data shape modern narratives and systems of influence. </p>

    <p class="descriptions">
When it comes to technology, Nia’s favorite device is her MacBook. She appreciates its seamless integration with other Apple products, especially the ease of connecting AirPods, copying content directly from her phone, and mirroring her mobile screen onto her laptop. For her, the intuitive user experience and cross-device functionality make it an indispensable tool for both academic work and creative projects.
