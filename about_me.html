Hi! My name is Joe Weckwerth and I am a senior at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, pursuing a double major in Information Science and Economics. I am deeply interested in the evolving intersection of healthcare and finance, and I am driven by a commitment to understanding how data and technology can strengthen healthcare systems and improve outcomes for communities.

    <p class="descriptions">
I currently work as a Finance Assistant in the UW–Madison Department of Dermatology, where I support financial operations and gain firsthand experience in the administrative structures that shape modern healthcare. My work in this department has deepened my interest in the industry and strengthened my motivation to contribute meaningful innovation within the healthcare and health-tech space. 

    <p class="descriptions">
Beyond academics and work, I am an avid golfer and continually seek opportunities to grow, both personally and professionally. My long-term ambition is to become a founder and leader of a company that can align my mission with my values, which are combining strategic thinking, innovation, and impactful decision-making. I strive to bring curiosity, integrity, and initiative to every environment I step into as I work toward becoming a transformative leader in the field.
