            <h1>What is Intersectionality and Implicit Bias?</h1>

            <h2>Implicit Bias</h2>
            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Implicit Biases are the unconscious attitudes, beliefs, or stereotypes that affect our understanding, actions, and decisions. These biases operate without our conscious awareness and can influence everything from perceptions and judgments to behaviors in a wide range of interactions. They are shaped by a lifetime of experiences, including those from family, friends, media, and cultural environments.</p> 
            
            <p>You should try Harvard’s Implicit Bias Test, but in my opinion, you should take the results with a grain of salt. The format of the test feels more like a memory game, and the questions lack any intersectional nuance, as they focus solely on one characteristic instead of many characteristics at once. Still, it’s a useful exercise to experience firsthand.</p>

            <h2>Intersectionality</h2>
            
            <p><strong>Definition:</strong>Intersectionality is a framework for understanding how different aspects of a person’s identity overlap and interact to shape their experiences, opportunities, and challenges.</p> 
            <p>Often times, skepticism toward intersectionality often stems from anti-intellectualism. To counter this, people should be encouraged to critically analyze their own identities, which can help them appreciate the efforts some people have taken to reduce this and understand bias. </p>
