    When deciding our tech heroes, we wanted to ensure that we were picking individuals with multiple identities that caused them to face challenges not only in the tech industry, but in life as a whole. That is why we chose Angelica Ross and Diego Mariscal, as our barrier-breaking, stigma-countering tech heroes.

  <h2>Angelica Ross</h2>
 <p class="descriptions"> <!-- To design this .descriptions{ in stylepage.css -->
  Through adversity, comes a triumphant story. Angelica Ross was born in Kenosha, Wisconsin on November 28, 1980. Ross knew from a young age that she presented herself as feminine. While trying to live in her truth, her mother, an evangelical Christian, often showed her disapproval of Ross’s perception of her identity. After attending college and the U.S. Navy briefly, Ross connected with a drag queen named Traci Ross who helped her transition, thus getting her new last name in her honor. Ross’s transition ultimately left her relationship with her mother estranged, forcing her to support herself through working at Applebee’s, as an escort, and eventually beginning her tech career as a web manager. In 2005, Angelica Ross began her acting career. As a result, Ross featured in multiple critically acclaimed roles in shows such as "Pose" and "American Horror Story".

As mentioned above, Ross began her tech career in web management. Along with teaching herself coding, Ross taught herself graphic design and photography, which later helped her obtain a position at the Chicago House’s Translife Center which assists in providing support to trans individuals. With her acting career on the rise, Ross never lost her love for supporting her community and tech. In 2014, Angelica Ross founded TransTech Social Enterprises, which helps trans individuals in developing skills and obtaining career opportunities in the tech industry. She also is the president of Miss Ross, Inc., a multi-faceted business that has created a community of likeminded social entrepreneurs. Regardless of what Angelica Ross does, there is no denying that she will always be remembered for creating spaces for trans individuals to thrive.

  <!-- Section for bio and image of Diego Mariscal  -->
  <h2>Diego Mariscal</h2>
 <p class="descriptions"> <!-- To design this .descriptions{ in stylepage.css -->
 Disabled and proud, Diego Mariscal was born in Monterrey, Mexico prematurely and diagnosed with cerebral palsy, a group of neurological disorders that affect one’s movement, muscle tone, and posture. Cerebral palsy can also affect speech and language skills. Despite these challenges, Mariscal has been able to defy all odds. Mariscal credits his accomplishments and achievements with a strong foundation during his childhood. Mariscal’s parents treated him just like his younger, able-bodied brother. Thus, Mariscal was rarely treated differently because of his disability in his home.

 <p class="descriptions"> <!-- To design this .descriptions{ in stylepage.css -->
Mariscal’s achievements include becoming a paralympic for the national Mexico team, creating a startup at age 18 called Limitless Prepa Tec, a disability awareness educational program that reached various schools in Mexico, and of course, founding 2Gether-International in 2019, Mariscal’s most recent endeavor that acts as a startup accelerator for entrepreneurs with disabilities. Since the start of the company, over $84 million has been secured for entrepreneurs with disabilities through 2Gether-International. Mariscal, in addition, serves on multiple U.S. organizations’ boards and entrepreneurship advisory committees. Yet, Mariscal’s effect on the world does not just consist of these achievements. Through his impactful storytelling and courage to be vulnerable with various audiences, Mariscal advocates for people to see disabled people for who they are, but not choose to limit them because of their disabilities.
