            <p>Often hailed as one of the true "Hidden Figures" of computing history, Dr. Gladys West’s mathematical brilliance laid the foundation for a technology we use every single day: GPS. Born in 1930 in rural Virginia to a family of sharecroppers, West worked tirelessly to secure an education as her path to a different life. After graduating top of her class from Virginia State University, she was hired in 1956 by the U.S. Naval Proving Ground, becoming one of only four Black employees at the facility. In an era of deep segregation and gender bias, she let her calculations speak for themselves, quickly rising to become a project manager for data-processing systems used in satellite analysis.</p>

            <p>West’s most significant contribution began in the 1970s when she programmed the massive IBM 7030 "Stretch" computer to deliver increasingly precise calculations for the shape of the Earth—a model known as the geoid. Her complex algorithms had to account for gravitational forces, tides, and other distorting forces that affect satellite position. It was this incredibly detailed mathematical model that allowed for the creation of the Global Positioning System (GPS). Despite her pivotal role, her contributions went largely unrecognized for decades until she was finally inducted into the Air Force Space and Missile Pioneers Hall of Fame in 2018.</p>
